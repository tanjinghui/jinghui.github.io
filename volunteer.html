    <p>
     Co-led Zen drumming and vocal performance teams with 1 YL for Vesak Day 2025. 
    We worked closely with 1 staff member to ensure smooth rehearsal operations and uphold the musical standards set. We fostered a supportive and encouraging environment where all members felt comfortable to express themselves and contribute meaningfully. Seeing each member’s growth from start to end has been incredibly fulfilling. Through this experience, I honed my ability to be a present listener and empathise with others. I also learned the importance of meeting people where they are.
